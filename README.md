# hexaclock
A simple clock JS app that tells the time and shows colors in hex.

## Why did I make this?

Honestly, I was bored and just wanted to build something.

## Where can I see it in action?

I'm glad you asked. The code is working live [here](https://rgaspary.github.io/furry-computing-machine/)
